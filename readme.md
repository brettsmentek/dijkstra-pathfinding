## Testing ##
- Train lines with times are added here: ```// add new lines with time definitions```
- Train lines without times are added here: ```// add new lines without time definitions```
- Challenge 1 can be run by un-commenting the lines without times
- Challenge 2 can be run by commenting the lines with times
- The implementation will not report a time unless all lines are given time estimates
